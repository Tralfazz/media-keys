# Media Keys

Gnome-shell extension that adds Media Player buttons to the panel.

## Notes

* The extension uses **playerctl** to control all MPRIS audio streams so it needs to be installed
* **mpris-proxy** also needs to run first
* work in progress, need to find out how to get the current state of the player
* this is a fork of https://github.com/mafflin/media-keys

## dependencies
* mpris-proxy
* playerctl
